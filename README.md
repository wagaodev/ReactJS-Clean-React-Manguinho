## The goal of the training is to demonstrate how to create a system in ReactJS using the new Hooks, Recoil, with a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a work methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS and applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
